In Brief A new type of microglia associated with restricting neurodegeneration may have important implications for treatment of Alzheimerâ€™s and related diseases.

Highlights:

- Single-cell RNA-seq in Alzheimer's model identified a novel microglia type (DAM)
- DAM are Alzheimer's disease-associated phagocytic cells conserved in mice and human
- DAM are activated sequentially by Trem2-independent and -dependent pathways
- DAM activation requires downregulation of microglia inhibitory-checkpoint pathways

## Data description

This study contains single-cell RNA sequencing data from immune cells isolated from mouse models of neurodegenerative diseases, particularly focusing on Alzheimer's disease (AD).
The dataset includes:

1. Alzheimer's disease model (**5XFAD** transgenic mice) vs wild-type controls

   - Whole brain, cortex, and cerebellum samples at various time points (1, 3, 6, 8, and 9 months)
2. Amyotrophic lateral sclerosis (ALS) model (**SOD1** mice) vs controls

   - Spinal cord samples at early (80 days) and late (135 days) disease stages
3. Aging comparison

   - Young (7 weeks) vs aged (20 months) wild-type mice
4. Trem2 knockout experiment

   - 5XFAD, Trem2-/-, Trem2-/- 5XFAD, and wild-type controls at 6 months

Key specifications:

- Organism: Mus musculus
- Experiment type: Expression profiling by high throughput sequencing
- Platform: Illumina NextSeq 500
- Cell isolation: CD45+, CD11b+, CD11c+, and other immune cell markers used for sorting
- Sequencing: Deep sequencing of tens of thousands of cells
- Data processed using MARS-seq protocol

The study identifies a novel microglia type associated with neurodegenerative diseases (**DAM**) and characterizes its activation through a two-step process involving Trem2-independent and Trem2-dependent pathways.

Raw data is deposited in GEO under accession GSE98969, with **97 samples** included in the dataset.

This comprehensive dataset allows for the identification and characterization of immune cell populations, particularly microglia subtypes, across different neurodegenerative conditions, disease progression stages, and genetic backgrounds.

## Comments

From our first analysis the aged microglia display up-regulation of disease-specific genes.
Compare the index of similarity between the bulk RNA-seq of disease-associated microglia (DAM).
